      Imagine a database with the topic: '{{database_start_table_name}}' 
      Please complete the following list of tasks, answering accurately and responding only with the required term and format.
      
      1. Give an appropriate name for the database.
      Here is one of the tables in the database with some sample rows:
      
      {{start_table}}
      
      2. Specify an appropriate and realistic name for the given table.
      
      3. Since the column names are rather generic, please find a name for each column that is more realistic and related to the database topic domain '{{database_start_table_name}}'. If there is no better name, keep the original attribute name.
      
      Respond with a JSON object that contains the improved database name, improved table name, and list of improved column names.

      Imagine a database with the topic: '{{database_start_table_name}}' and the database name '{{database_name}}'.
      Please complete the following list of tasks, answering accurately and responding only with the required term and format.
      Here is one of the tables in the database with some sample rows:
      
      {{fk_table}}
      
      1. The current name of the table is '{{fk_table_name}}' and the table is referenced to from the following other tables: {{fk_relationships}}. Specify a better name for the given table, especially considering the content of the given table and the references {{fk_columns}}, or keep the current table name if it is already suitable.
      
      2. Since the column names are rather generic, please find a name for each column that is more realistic and related to the table and database topic domain. If there is no better name, keep the original attribute name.
      Respond with a JSON object that contains the improved table name and the list of improved column names.
