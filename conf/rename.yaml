      Here is one of the tables in the database with some sample rows:
      {{start_table}}
      2. Specify an appropriate and realistic name for the given table.
      3. Since the column names are rather generic, please find a name for each column that is more realistic and related to the database topic domain {{database_start_table_name}}. Respond with a comma-separated list in Python containing the new attribute names. If there is no better name, keep the original attribute name.
